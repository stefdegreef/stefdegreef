# About me

**stefdegreef/stefdegreef** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the French translation of [www.mapswipe.org](https://web.mapswipe.org)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use GitHub (no kidding, never used other before today !)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on plenty of mapping projects all over the world
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about maps, (organic) bugs, Belgium, first aid, tropics, humanitarian relief work.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him for now
- âš¡ Fun fact: once upon a time, I discovered a lost city in the jungle.
